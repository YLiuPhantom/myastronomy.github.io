Theoretically explained a possible comet shower caused by HD 7977’s flyby 3 Myr ago, analyzed comet duration, intensity, and its impact on the ancient Earth. Collected geographic evidence of craters and comet components, revealing that this comet shower could be the cause of the Pliocene-Pleistocene Transition. Image credit: AAAS | Science.",
